Weather-Reader
=====================

-a simple no frills weather reading app

I put this on Github to show the source code of my iOS application

aside from the icon (which my wife designed), I made the app. I learned this using object oriented design and MVC along with some textbooks on iOS development. I am working on version 2 of this app and will post the source code when it is finished
